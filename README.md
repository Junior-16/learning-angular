# Task Manager App
### Application Description </br>
  This branch contains the code related to the project developed for the purpose of practicing the concepts of the angular framework.
  TaskManager is a silly application that allows you to create reminders to your daily tasks. To create a task you need a name, a description, a dead line and a classification. 
You can classify a new task in 4 ways: 
 - **Fucked**;
 - **Danger**;
 - **There's Time**;
 - **GG Easy**;

Fucked represents a task whose deadline is very close, Danger classification represents a potential Fucked task, There's Time classification is self-explanatory and finally GG Easy is for the tasks that will not be done today or tomorrow at all.

TaskManager gets his resources from [taskmanager-service](https://github.com/Junior-16/taskmanager-service) through asynchronous https requests.
